# Full Stack Web Application
This project started as a simple group project in my database class, where the only goal was to simply build and demonstrate an SQL schema with a presentation. We decided for our presentation we would build a functioning website that our classmates
could interact with during the presentation, which simulated a grocery store checkout register and allowed them to see the app change in real time as others added new data. This turned out to be more work than everything else in the project combined, but it was
worth it. We worked in a group of three people, and I was the one responsible for constructing the database schema and the backend server that would allow the website to interact with the database. At the start of the project, I knew nothing about
web development, and didn't even know where to begin. During a seminar, I was introduced to the Spring Framework, and decided I would try to use that. After a few hours of tutorials, I was able to build a basic server and have it handle client requests.
I built a more robust version for our project, and was able to connect it to the database we were using. I then refined it, implementing security checks and having the server access the database through stored procedures in an attempt to prevent common attacks.
With the backend completed, I made a Python script to fill the database with sample data. I then helped my groupmate, who was responsible for the frontend website, create the necessary calls to access the server, learning a fair bit about JavaScript in the process. Finally, we were able to place both the server and site on a spare machine and domain
he had, and were able to sucessfully host it on an HTTPS connection. The demonstration went off without a hitch, and my classmates and professor were very impressed. I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish, as are my groupmates.\
